🩺 INTERPRETATION SUMMARY
1) Cost and bureaucratic barriers show the strongest co-occurrence with 'avoid' intent.
2) Pregnancy-related subreddits (BabyBumps, pregnant, GestationalDiabetes) show higher emotional tone and more stigma mentions.
3) Chronic condition subreddits (diabetes_t1/t2) show steadier sentiment but higher cost discussions.
4) Negative sentiment correlates moderately with avoidance intent across all communities.
5) Overall, cost + stigma barriers appear to have the largest predictive effect on care-seeking delay or avoidance.
